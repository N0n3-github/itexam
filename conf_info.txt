1) In MySQL create a database to keep "itexam" information there. Ex db name: "itexam".
   It is better if encode type will be in "utf8_general_ci"

2) Go to file "config.php" and correct the connection to your MySQL database you just created.

//Manage questions and adminpanel guide here...

n) Default token for registrating an admin is 'VG9rZW4=' (the word "Token" encoded in Base64).
   If you want to change it then go to "adminpanel/registration.php" and change the checking 
   token on line 20 to that you want.
