1) In MySQL create a database to keep "itexam" information there. Ex db name: "itexam". 
2) Go to file "config.php" and correct the connection to your MySQL database you just created.


//Remove after creating adminpanel

Notice: The names that called below like "questions" should be written exactly like that.
If you put even one capital letter in that name, project won't work.

2) In database you created, create a new table called "questions" which contains 7 cols.
Name that cols exactly like this:
"id" -> with PRIMARY index and AI (auto increment)
"question" -> for holding the question (text type with a long of 255 symbols)
"a" -> for "A" answer text (text type with a long of 255 symbols)
"b" -> for "B" answer text (text type with a long of 255 symbols)
"c" -> for "C" answer text (text type with a long of 255 symbols)
"d" -> for "D" answer text (text type with a long of 255 symbols)
"right_answer" -> for right answer (this col should be in a type of var_char and contain only 1 char symbol)
