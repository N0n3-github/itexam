Hello and welcome to itexam repository. This project was created by Sultanov Mirodil in 2019 and all the license information 
is written in license.txt

<h2>About project</h2>
This project is created for testing the knowledge on any theme you want.<br>
It would be much more interesting if this project will be used in a localnetwork, because it would be like a contest.

<h2>Installation</h2>
All you need is to install LAMP server if you are on GNU/LinuxOS and configure it.<br>
If you are on WindowsOS then just install OpenServer and configure that too the way you want.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
All configuration info is written in conf_info.txt.<br>
So after installation the LAMP/OpenServer go to that file and follow the guide.
