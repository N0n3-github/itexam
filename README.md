<h1>IT Exam</h1>

Hello and welcome to itexam repository

<h2>About project</h2>
This project is created for testing the knowledge on any theme you want.
It would be much more interesting if this project will be used in a localnetwork, because it would be like a contest.

Installation
All you need is to install LAMP server if you are on GNU/LinuxOS and configure it.
If you are on WindowsOS then just install OpenServer and configure that too the way you want.

Configuration
All configuration info is written in conf_info.txt. 
So after installation the LAMP/OpenServer go to that file and follow the guide.
